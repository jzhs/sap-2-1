# sap-2-1
Malvino SAP-2 first attempt



# Backstory

In earlier projects I implemented Malvino's SAP-1 computer
in Verilog for the Basys3 board.

[sap-1-1](https://github.com/jzhs/sap-1-1)

[sap-1-2](https://github.com/jzhs/sap-1-2)

[sap-1-3](https://github.com/jzhs/sap-1-3)


Sap-1-1 and 1-2 were the same except that 1-2 used a microprogrammed
control unit.

One thing I learned is that flipping little slide switches and reading
LEDs is no way to program anything. I noticed that 
in the Malvino and Brown text hex i/o is part of SAP-2 so I got a
little head start on that. 

Sap-1-3 extended sap-1-2 by adding hexadecimal i/o via the onboard
7-segment display and a
[PMOD hexadecimal keypad](https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-kypd-16-button-keypad/)
that I bought.


Now its time to move on to the SAP-2.
