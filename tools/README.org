
These are some basic batch files etc to script the operation of
vivado. In other words, from the command line you can simulate,
synthesize, implement, and write to the Basys3 fpga. A lot more could
be done here but I'm not going to do it now.

Basic use is to copy and re3name the directory sap-1-3/build-ex to a place
parallel to sap-1-3. Eg build-sap-1-3. So now sap-1-3 and
build-sap-1-3 have the same parent.



1. Run testbench simulations
   > sim.bat

   Runs xvlog, then xelab, then xsim. Ends by opening vivado gui so I
   can see the waveform. Basic information from:
   https://www.itsembedded.com/dhd/vivado_sim_1/

2. Make bitstream
   > makebits.bat

3. Program the board
   > prog.bat
